## üìñ Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for an **individual-based modeling framework** developed to study invasive plant dynamics, specifically focusing on:

* Litter feedback effects and potential regime shifts in invaded ecosystems.
* Seed dispersal mechanisms and the influence of legacy trees on invasion spread.
* Spatial distribution and population-level consequences for *Melaleuca quinquenervia*.

The IBM explicitly represents individuals, their growth, mortality, dispersal, and interactions with the environment, enabling flexible exploration of invasion dynamics across ecological contexts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* MATLAB R2020a or later (earlier versions may also work).
* No specialized toolboxes required beyond base MATLAB functions.
* Scripts are self-contained; datasets are either generated within the code or included as `.mat` files.

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/IndividualBasedModel-Invasion.git
   cd IndividualBasedModel-Invasion
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and run the main simulation scripts:

   ```matlab
   % Example: run invasion simulation with default parameters
   main_simulation
   ```

3. Adjust ecological and simulation parameters in the configuration section of the scripts (e.g., initial density, dispersal kernel, litter effects, simulation duration).

4. Outputs include:

   * Time series of population density and composition.
   * Spatial maps of individuals across the landscape.
   * Figures matching those in the related publications.
